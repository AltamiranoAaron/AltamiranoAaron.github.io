    <p>My favorite animal is the panda. I like the pandas because they are cute and they look fluffy. I also like pandas because they are both silly and lazy at the same time. There are the white and black pandas which can get very large and then the red pandas which stay smaller in size. I don't have a preference for which one I like more, I just think they're both cute.</p>
